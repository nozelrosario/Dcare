################# Dcare Pending tasks ################
======= General ============ 
# Implement required validations & null checks on all data entry screens.
# migrate to new angular-material version. Involves migrating the css code...tedious job :(
# introduce busy indicators for all the long-going processes, like "save", "setReminder", "etc".
	Try for a generic solution, like have the busyIndicator on model-provider-service OR on data-store level itself.
# for all the modules, $scope.changeState() can be used to navigate to parent page.
	Re-name this method on each controller to say "$scope.navigateBack().and also call this on click of back button of title bar.

======= Dashboard ======= 
when clicking ad new patient, the registration page that opes is missing back/close button.

	
======= Registration ======= 
 ## field validations on registration screen
 
======= Medication =========
 ## Medication - add dose field on ui
 ## All medications list implement.
 
 
 @@ could implement a medicine stock tracking logic, which keeps track of remaining medicine stock and alert accordingly to refill the stock.

======= Reminders ==========
 ## Back button on new/edit form
 ## Reminders : currently it is possible to set multiple  reminders for same medication/orignator. coz. there is no provision for maintaining 
		reference of reminder <=> medication. Try to build up a generic relationship provision , and also filtering mechanism in reminders.
